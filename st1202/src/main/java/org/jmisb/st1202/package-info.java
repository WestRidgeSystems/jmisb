/**
 * MISB ST 1202.2 Generalized Transformation Parameters.
 *
 * <p>This standard describes a generalized method of transforming two-dimensional data (or points)
 * from one coordinate system into a second two-dimensional coordinate system. This Generalized
 * Transformation may be used for various image-to-image transformations such as an affine
 * transformation by simply equating some parameters to be equal to zero. In addition, this
 * Generalized Transformation may describe some homographic-like transformations.
