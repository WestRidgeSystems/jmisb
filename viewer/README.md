# jMISB viewer

This directory contains a Java Swing-based GUI to visualize video and metadata on the desktop. It is primarily intended to exercise the API for development and testing, and not as an end user tool.

To run it from the command line, from the `viewer` directory, run:
```sh
mvn exec:exec
```
