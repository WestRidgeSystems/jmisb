## About

jMISB is an open source Java library implementing various
[MISB](http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb/ "MISB home page") standards. The
project was begun in March 2017, and version 1.0.0 was released on
May 23, 2018. It leverages the excellent work by
[bytedeco](https://github.com/bytedeco) on bringing video support to Java.
Stay tuned here for updates, and please let us know if you have suggestions
or would like to participate!

## Why jMISB?

The Motion Imagery Standards Board, or MISB's mission is to develop and
maintain standards for interoperability between motion imagery systems in use
within the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC).

The goal of the jMISB project is to provide an open implementation of
these standards and allow government and industry to leverage them more easily
and effectively. The jMISB project is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by
MISB in any way.

## Scope

The MISB has been quite prolific in creation of new standards since its
inception in 2000. As of March 2017, over three dozen standards are listed
on its web site. While the scope of the jMISB project is to support as many of
these standards as possible, the initial focus will be on those
in most widespread use. Usage is not easy to quantify, so we anticipate
making course corrections based on feedback from the community. The initial
set of standards to be supported are:

| Identifier | Name | Implementation Status | Known Issues |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| ST 0102 | Security Metadata Universal and Local Sets for Digital Motion Imagery | Implemented as of ST 0102.12. There is read-only support for some tags (not UMID) that were removed in ST 0102.12. | |
| EG 0104 | Predator UAV Basic Universal Metadata Set | Read only support for EG 0104.5. Writing is not planned, since this is deprecated. | |
| ST 0601 | UAS Datalink Local Set | Mostly implemented as of ST 0102.16a. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/140> |
| ST 0603 | MISP Time System and Timestamps | Partly implemented as of ST 0603.5. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/97> |
| ST 0604 | Timestamps for Class 1 / Class 2 Motion Imagery | Partly implemented as of ST 0604.6. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/102> |
| ST 0805 | KLV to Cursor-on-Target (CoT) Conversions | Partly implemented. Limited testing. | |
| ST 0806 | Remote Video Terminal Metadata Set | Implemented as of ST 0806.5. Unit tests only, no interoperability testing. | |
| ST 0903 | Video Moving Target Indicator and Track Metadata | Implemented as of ST 0903.5. No support for pre-0903.4 files. Unit testing only, no interoperability testing. | |
| ST 1201 | Floating Point to Integer Mapping | Mostly implemented per ST1201.4. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/72> |
| ST 1204 | Motion Imagery Identification System (MIIS) Core Identifier | Implemented as of ST 1204.3. | |
| ST 1402 | MPEG-2 Transport Stream for Class 1/Class 2 Motion Imagery, Audio, and Metadata | Mostly implemented. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/103>, <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/119> |
| ST 1909 | Metadata Overlay for Visualization | Implementation in progress. Not yet merged. | <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb/issues/61> |

jMISB aims to be cross-platform to run on any modern operating system. However,
some OSes are more widely used than others, and we will prioritize those to
reach the widest audience possible. The OSes we are initially targeting are:

1. Windows
2. Linux
3. Android
4. MacOS

## Building

To build the library from the command line, simply run the Maven command:

```sh
mvn package
```

This will compile the source code, run unit tests, and generate the JAR files.

To get started, you may want to run `jmisb-viewer` and experiment
with some test data. This is a sample application intended mainly to aid in
development. To run it from the command line, issue:

```sh
cd viewer
mvn exec:exec
```

## Including in Your Project

If you are using a dependency management tool such as Maven with access to the
[Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/), you can configure it to use
jMISB as a dependency. For Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jmisb</groupId>
        <artifactId>jmisb-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.9.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

For Gradle, include the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.jmisb', name: 'jmisb-api', version: '1.9.0'
}
```

## API Usage

See the [javadocs](https://westridgesystems.github.io/jmisb) for a complete API
reference.

A primary objective of jMISB is to provide an easy-to-use API allowing
non-domain experts to create applications leveraging MISB standards.
Below is a simple example of reading a network stream containing video
and (optionally) metadata.

```java
try (IVideoStreamInput stream = new VideoStreamInput())
{
    stream.open("udp://225.1.1.1:35800");
    stream.addFrameListener(exampleProcessor);
    stream.addMetadataListener(exampleProcessor);
}
catch (IOException e)
{
    System.out.println("Could not open the stream");
}
```

The `ExampleProcessor` class simply needs to implement the
`IVideoListener` and `IMetadataListener` interfaces
to receive video and metadata asynchronously as the data arrives.

```java
class ExampleProcessor implements IVideoListener, IMetadataListener
{
    @Override
    private void onVideoReceived(VideoFrame frame)
    {
        BufferedImage image = frame.getImage();
        System.out.println("Center pixel RGB: " +
            image.getRGB(image.getWidth()/2, image.getHeight()/2));
    }

    @Override
    private void onMetadataReceived(MetadataFrame frame)
    {
        IMisbMessage metadata = frame.getMisbMessage();
        if (metadata instanceof UasDatalinkMessage)
        {
            UasDatalinkMessage msg = (UasDatalinkMessage)metadata;
            System.out.println("Sensor position: " +
                msg.getField(UasDatalinkTag.SensorLatitude).getDisplayableValue() +
                ", " +
                msg.getField(UasDatalinkTag.SensorLongitude).getDisplayableValue());
        }
        else if (metadata instanceof SecurityMetadataMessage)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The result of `msg.getField(UasDatalinkTag.SensorLatitude)` will be an instance
of the `SensorLatitude` class (`IUasDatalinkValue` is a superclass), and this
relationship holds in general.

More complete examples of usage may be found in the `viewer` demo
application and in unit tests. Additional sample applications are a work in
progress.

## Versioning

jMISB adheres to *semantic versioning* to communicate to client
developers about the scope of changes in any new release. Version numbers
are formatted as `major.minor.patch`, where:

1. The major number is incremented to indicate incompatible API changes.
2. The minor number is incremented to indicate new functionality has been
added, but in a backward-compatible manner.
3. The patch number is incremented to indicate a backwards-compatible bug
fix.

In other words, users of the library should feel comfortable updating to use
a new version unless the major number has changed. In general, users should
keep up to date with the latest patch release for a given
`major.minor` release branch.

Use of -SNAPSHOT within the version number indicates that the version is
for internal development only, i.e., the artifact is not to be used in a
production environment.
