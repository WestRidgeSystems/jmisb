# Simple command line example for jMISB

This is demonstration / example code for <https://github.com/WestRidgeSystems/jmisb>

It does a console dump of the KLV metadata in a file to standard output (`System.out` in Java, hence the name).

It is optimised for the case where there is KLV (in particular, it skips decoding video), and files that do not contain KLV may not behave well.

## Building

To build it, use maven.

``` sh
mvn clean install
```

## Using

There are several ways to invoke it. One way is:

``` sh
java -jar target/systemout-1.10.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  {filename}
```

For example:

``` sh
java -jar target/systemout-1.10.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar ~/KLV_samples/CheyenneVAhospital.mpeg4
```

You should adjust the version part to match the current version number.

That will produce console output - you can redirect it to a file using standard command line functionality,
since there will likely be a lot of output.

The output looks like:

## Multiple files

You can run it on a directory using a shell script like:

``` sh
for f in ~/KLV_samples/*
do
    if test -f "$f"; then
        echo "Processing" "$f"
        java -jar target/systemout-1.10.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar "$f" > "$(basename "$f").klv.txt"
    fi
done
```

where `~/KLV_samples` is the directory containing KLV videos to parse.

Adjust as required if you aren't using Linux or have a different structure.

## Helping us

If you have files that you are confident have standard KLV metadata, and its not working correctly, please report issues and send pull requests. If you can't send pull requests, sample data will help to get your issues resolved.
