/**
 * AWT integration for ST 0602 Annotation Metadata Set.
 *
 * <p>This Standard documents the SMPTE KLV metadata to encode annotation data within a motion
 * imagery data stream. This Standard also provides direction on the creation of "Annotation" KLV
 * metadata to allow for the creation, dissemination, and display of visual cues to enhance the
 * exploitation of MISP-compliant motion imagery data.
 *
 * <p>Most of the ST 0602 logic including all parsing is handled by {@link org.jmisb.st0602}. This
 * package provides rendering support via AWT (see {@link java.awt.image}).
