 * no VMTI detection can be correlated with it.
 *
 * <p>Active: Detections for the entity established or updated based on associated VMTI report or
 * prediction. An entity can resume this state by transition from Stopped or Dropped to "moving when
 * a VMTI detection (or a prediction) with a new position has become associated with it.
 *
 * <p>Dropped: The entity could not be correlated with any VMTI detection for an interval of time
 * exceeding a specified threshold. An entity can remain in a Dropped or "lost" condition for an
 * indeterminate period if there is some likelihood it may resume (Active) again. Eventually, it may
 * become Inactive.
 *
 * <p>Stopped: The entity has either become stationary or was always in a fixed location.
