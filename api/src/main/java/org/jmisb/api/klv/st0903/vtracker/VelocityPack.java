/**
 * Velocity Pack.
 *
 * <p>This data transfer object supports the VTarget Velocity.
 *
 * <p>The Velocity DLP structure captures data about the velocity of a moving object. The DLP is a
 * truncation pack where groups of data are optional unless needed (truncated from the end only).
 * There are three defined groups. The first, and highest priority group includes East, North and Up
 * velocity components; these provide the measurements of velocity along the coordinate axes of the
 * East-North-Up coordinate system specified by the Location Truncation Pack for the location of the
 * moving object. The second group, Standard Deviations and medium priority group, provides standard
 * deviations for the first group measurements. The third group, Correlation Coefficients and lowest
 * priority group, provides three correlation coefficients for values in the first group.
 *
 * <p>East, North and Up are always required.
 *
 * <p>If setting individual components, be aware that the standard deviations are conceptually a
 * single group. Similarly, the correlation values are "grouped". Unless all the elements in a group
 * are set, it won't make sense. Further, if the correlation group values are set, the standard
 * deviation group values also need to be set.
