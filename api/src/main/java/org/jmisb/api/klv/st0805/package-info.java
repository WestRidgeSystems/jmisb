/**
 * ST 0805: Cursor-on-Target (CoT) support.
 *
 * <p>This Standard (ST) defines the Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) metadata items used for
 * fields in Cursor on Target (CoT) Situational Awareness (SI) messages. Two CoT message conversions
 * from MISB-standard Key Length Value (KLV) metadata sets are described in this document â€“ Platform
 * Position and Sensor Point of Interest (SPI).
 *
 * <p>Conversions from both MISB ST 0601 UAS Datalink Local Data Set and MISB EG 0104.5 Predator
 * Universal Metadata Set are included here. The intent of this Standard is to provide a method of
 * generating CoT messages either in real time or at a later date from motion imagery files and the
 * results should be the same in either case.
