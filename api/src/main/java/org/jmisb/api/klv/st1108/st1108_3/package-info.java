 * ST 1108.3: Interpretability and Quality Local Set.
 *
 * <p>This document defines metadata for documenting image metrics and compression characteristics
 * within a Motion Imagery stream or file. Such metadata facilitates documenting the quality of
 * Motion Imagery along the imaging workflow with objective metrics or subjective interpretability
 * criteria providing valuable information to the end user. Encoding the metadata as binary KLV (Key
 * Length Value) supports encapsulation in MISP-approved containers. Metric computation is area
 * based defined by a starting Frame and an ending Frame.
