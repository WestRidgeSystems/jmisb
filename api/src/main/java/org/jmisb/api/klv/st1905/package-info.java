/**
 * ST 1905 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Platform.
 *
 * <p>ST 1901, ST 1902, ST 1903, ST 1904, ST 1905, ST 1906, ST 1907 and ST 1908 collectively define
 * Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD). The Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD) Model includes information
 * about platforms that host payloads. ST 1905 defines the modeling information about the different
 * types of platforms and their specific attributes. The platform model includes classes for the
 * Staging system (which is described in ST 1906) and Payloads (which is described in ST 1907).
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: Most of the implementation of this document is generated from the Motion
 * Imagery Modeling Language (MIML) representation.
