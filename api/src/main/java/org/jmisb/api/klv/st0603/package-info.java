/**
 * ST 0603: MISP Time System and Timestamps.
 *
 * <p>From ST0603:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <p>An absolute, reliable time system is essential to precisely mark temporal events with
 * timestamps for collected Motion Imagery and metadata. Such timestamps facilitate photogrammetric
 * analysis, interoperability and exploitation of Motion Imagery products.
 *
 * <p>This standard specifies the MISP Time System, which is an absolute time scale from which
 * timestamps are derived. Three types of timestamps are defined: 1) a Precision Time Stamp, which
 * represents Absolute Time specified to microsecond resolution; 2) a Nano Precision Time Stamp,
 * which represents Absolute Time specified to nanosecond resolution; and, 3) a Commercial Time
 * Stamp, which represents a relative time consistent with time code used in the commercial
 * broadcast industry, specified to video frame resolution. The Precision Time Stamp and the Nano
 * Precision Time Stamp aide in correlating Motion Imagery with metadata.
 *
 * <p>This standard also specifies a Time Status byte, which is intended to provide additional
 * information regarding the source used for timestamps
 *
