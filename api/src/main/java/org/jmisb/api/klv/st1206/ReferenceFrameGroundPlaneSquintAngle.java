 * Reference Frame Ground Plane Squint Angle (ST1206 Tag 25).
 *
 * <p>The reference frame squint angle may be expressed as the Doppler cone angle between the ground
 * track vector and the radarâ€™s line-of-sight vector or as a ground squint angle, which is the
 * corresponding angle projected onto the ground plane. Here, the ground plane is the geodetic plane
 * orthogonal to the ellipsoid normal at the SRP of the reference plane although it may also be
 * defined as the geocentric plane. The compliment for the current SAR image used in the creation of
 * the SAR coherent change products is defined in @link{GroundPlaneSquintAngle}.
 *
 * <p>See ST1206 Section 6.3 for more information.
