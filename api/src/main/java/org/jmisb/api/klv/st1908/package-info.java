/**
 * ST 1908 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Imager System.
 *
 * <p>ST 1901, ST 1902, ST 1903, ST 1904, ST 1905, ST 1906, ST 1907 and ST 1908 collectively define
 * Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD). The Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD) Model includes information
 * about Imagers hosted by Payloads (see MISB ST 1905). An Imager is a device for converting Scene
 * Energy (e.g., visible, or infrared light) to an image. For example, a visible light camera is an
 * Imager with lenses, filters, and a sensor array (e.g., CCD or CMOS). The scope of this standard
 * is describing the modeling information about Imagers, their lenses, and other Imager aspects.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: Most of the implementation of this document is generated from the Motion
 * Imagery Modeling Language (MIML) representation.
