/**
 * ST 1907 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Payload.
 *
 * <p>ST 1901, ST 1902, ST 1903, ST 1904, ST 1905, ST 1906, ST 1907 and ST 1908 collectively define
 * Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD). The Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD) Model includes information
 * about Payloads hosted by Platforms (see ST 1905). A Payload is a device or system of devices
 * attached to a Platform for accomplishing the objectives of the system. Devices include general
 * purpose intelligence gathering systems such as visible light cameras, infrared cameras, SAR, ESM,
 * LIDAR, HSI, MSI, and acoustical devices, for example, a Motion Imagery system with its lenses,
 * filters, and sensor arrays. The Payload model currently does not include weapon systems. The
 * scope of this standard describes the modeling information about payloads with an initial focus on
 * Geo-Intelligence Sensors. Other payload types, e.g., acoustical devices, are future extensions.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: Most of the implementation of this document is generated from the Motion
 * Imagery Modeling Language (MIML) representation.
