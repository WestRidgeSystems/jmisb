/**
 * ST 1903 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Model.
 *
 * <p>ST 1901, ST 1902, ST 1903, ST 1904, ST 1905, ST 1906, ST 1907 and ST 1908 collectively define
 * Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD).
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: Most of the implementation of this document is generated from the Motion
 * Imagery Modeling Language (MIML) representation. ST 1903 and its supporting documents (ST 1904,
 * ST 1905, ST 1906, ST 1907 and ST 1908) define the MIMD model, which is a UML model organized as a
 * hierarchy of information including metadata for temporal, platform, payload, sensor, command,
 * automated processes, exploitation, security, and more. ST 1903, in concert with MISB ST 1901 and
 * MISB ST 1902, provides a suite of standards embodying the MIMD architecture.
