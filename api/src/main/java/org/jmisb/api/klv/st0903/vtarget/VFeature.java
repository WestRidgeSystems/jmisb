/**
 * VFeature (ST0903 VTarget Pack Tag 103).
 *
 * <p>From ST0903:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * Data which describes the target or features of the target (shape, size, dents, number of wheels,
 * thermal signature, etc.). Descriptive information can range from simple text for a label, to
 * complex data sets containing spectral or radiometric data. The definition of a set of elements to
 * describe target features can be a complex undertaking. Rather than create a unique specification,
 * the VFeature LS is based on ISO 19156 [10] and related schemas.
 *
 * <p>ISO 19156 defines a conceptual schema for observations and for features for sampling during
 * observation. These artifacts support the exchange of information describing the acts of
 * observation and their results. It also defines an observation as an act of measuring or otherwise
 * determining the value for properties of features of interest. Such an act may involve the use of
 * a method, sensor, instrument, human observation, algorithm, computation, process, etc. to
 * estimate the value of the property. An observation is associated with a discrete instant or
 * interval of time.
 *
 * <p>Values use a variety of scales including nominal, ordinal, ratio, interval, spatial, and
 * temporal. Combining primitive data types forms aggregate data types with aggregate values,
 * including vectors, tensors and images. A value may be exact, or it may be an estimate, with a
 * finite error. Observation results may have many data types, including primitive types like
 * category or measure, but also more complex types such as time, location and geometry
