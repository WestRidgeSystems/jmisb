     * Observation may involve use of a sensor or observer, analytical procedure, simulation, or
     * other mathematical process. An Observation yields an estimate of the value of a property of
     * the feature of interest and can account for error that may be present in the estimate.
     *
     * <p>Observation values may have many data types, from primitive to complex, including
     * category, measure, and geometry. Combinations of data types can encode properties having
     * multiple components. The notion of “coverage” is useful for properties that vary over the
     * feature of interest. O&amp;M Sampling addresses the sampling of sub-elements of a feature
     * used to represent the whole.
     *
     * <p>Schema is a required element of VFeature. However, for bandwidth efficiency since Scheme
     * appears periodically, SchemaFeature items in subsequent VTarget Packs reference the specified
     * schema.
