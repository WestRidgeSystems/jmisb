/**
 * Type of Identifier.
 * <p>
 * Sensor Identifiers and Platform Identifiers can be Physical, Virtual or
 * Managed identifiers.
 * <p>
 * From ST1204.3 Section 6.1.1:
 * <blockquote>
 * <b>Physical Identifier</b>: generated or stored <i>within</i> a device itself and
 * never changes over the lifetime of the device. Should the device be power
 * cycled the exact same identifier applies (i.e., persistent). Likewise,
 * removing the device from the system and later re-integrating (or moved to
 * another system) the same identifier applies for that device (i.e.,
 * consistent). Physical Identifiers are frame accurate, meaning every frame of
 * the Motion Imagery Data associates with a Physical Identifier. No device will
 * generate, store or use a predefined Physical Device Identifier assigned to
 * another device.
 * <p>
 * <b>Virtual Identifier</b>: generated or stored <i>outside</i> of the physical device
 * by an external host device (e.g., flight computer) and managed by that host
 * so it is persistent. If the device or host is power cycled the exact same
 * identifier applies (i.e., persistent). Similarly, the host will manage the
 * change to the Virtual Identifier when swapping or changing the device.
 * Inserting a Virtual Identifier into all copies of the Motion Imagery Data
 * sent from, or stored on, the platform maintains the ubiquitous nature of the
 * identifier. Although a Virtual Identifier does not need to be frame accurate,
 * requirement MISB ST 1204.1-12 places limits on its update rate.
 * <p>
 * <b>Managed Identifier</b>: generated or stored by the control station (e.g.,
 * GCS) and managed by the control station so it is persistent. Devices in a
 * control station need to provide the exact same identifier (i.e., persistent)
 * if power cycled. The control station will manage changes to the Managed
 * Identifier when swapping or changing the device. Although a Managed
 * Identifier does not need to be frame accurate, requirement MISB ST 1204.1-16
 * places limits on its update rate.
 * <p>
 * The difference between a Virtual Identifier and Managed Identifier is the
 * Virtual Identifier is ubiquitous while a Managed Identifier only serves users
 * downstream from the control station; this means a Virtual Identifier will be
 * a higher identifier quality level than a Managed Identifier.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Note: The values of these identifier types are those used in the Usage part of the Core
 * Identifier, without any bit shifting. So a Physical Identifier is {@code 0b11}, rather than
 * {@code 0b011xxxx0} for Sensor Physical Identifier or {@code 0b0xx11xx0} for a Platform Physical
 * Identifier.
