/**
 * ST 0806: Remote Video Terminal Metadata.
 * <p>
 * Users of the ROVER (Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver) require
 * additional metadata elements unique to its mission needs than are specified
 * in MISB ST 0601. The purpose of ST 0806 is to formalize a method of
 * communicating with a Remote Video Terminal (ROVER or other related programs,
 * such as the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT)), and create a
 * configuration-managed metadata standard to meet its needs with minimal
 * impacts to ST 0601 users. The RVT Local Set (LS) defined in ST 0806 can
 * stand as an independent local set, or be embedded within other metadata sets.
 * <p>
 * This provides the ability for system designers to produce or receive one, or
 * a mix of metadata elements from other sets based upon program requirements.
