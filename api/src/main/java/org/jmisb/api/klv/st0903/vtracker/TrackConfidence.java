/**
 * Tracker Confidence Level (ST0903 VTracker Pack Tag 7).
 *
 * <p>From ST0903:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * Confidence level expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100. Value 0 indicates no confidence; value
 * 100 percent indicates absolute certainty. Confidence is an estimation of the certainty or
 * correctness that the track described by the sequence of VMTI movement detections corresponds to
 * the same object. For example, detections derived from many unambiguous target reports, such as,
 * for a single vehicle on a road in a desert environment might signal high confidence. Reports
 * associated with several overlapping or nearby tracks in a partially obscured environment, such
 * as, for dismounts (people) in an urban setting might signal low confidence.
 *
 * <p>Valid values: The set of all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive
 *
 * </blockquote>
