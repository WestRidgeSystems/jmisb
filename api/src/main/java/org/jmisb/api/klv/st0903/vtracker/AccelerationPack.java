/**
 * Acceleration Pack.
 *
 * <p>This data transfer object supports the VTarget Acceleration.
 *
 * <p>The Acceleration DLP structure captures data about the acceleration of a moving object. The
 * DLP is a truncation pack where groups of data are optional unless needed (from the end only).
 * There are three defined groups as shown in Figure 18. The first, and highest priority group
 * includes East, North and Up components; these measurements provide acceleration along the
 * coordinate axes of the East-North-Up coordinate system specified by the Location pack for the
 * location of the moving object. The second group, Standard Deviations and medium priority group,
 * provides the standard deviations for the first group measurements. The third group, Correlation
 * Coefficients and lowest priority group, provides the three correlation coefficients for the
 * values in the first group.
 *
 * <p>East, North and Up are always required.
 *
 * <p>If setting individual components, be aware that the standard deviations are conceptually a
 * single group. Similarly, the correlation values are "grouped". Unless all the elements in a group
 * are set, it won't make sense. Further, if the correlation group values are set, the standard
 * deviation group values also need to be set.
