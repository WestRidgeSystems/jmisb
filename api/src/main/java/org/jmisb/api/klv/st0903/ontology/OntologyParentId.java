/**
 * Ontology Parent Id (Ontology LS Tag 2).
 *
 * <p>When detecting or tracking objects there may be several related classifications made for an
 * object. For example, a blob of pixels moving with a high velocity may classify as both a vehicle
 * (a generalization) with a confidence level of 90%, a car with a confidence level of 70%, and a
 * motorcycle with a confidence level of 50%. Vehicle is a generalization of both car and
 * motorcycle; this relationship between car and vehicle, and motorcycle and vehicle is indicated
 * with the parentId
 *
 * <p>When an OntologySeries has two related LS in the Series, the ParentId defines the link by
 * having the child define its parentId equal to the parent ontology object’s OntologyId. For
 * example, an OntologySeries having three elements: Vehicle with OntologyId 10, Car with OntologyId
 * 17, and Motorcycle with OntologyId 3. Since Car and Motorcycle are both “children” of the
 * Vehicle, those two LS define their ParentId’s equal to 10.
