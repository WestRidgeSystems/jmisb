 * <p>This document defines metadata keys necessary to express motion imagery interpretability and

 * <p>In addition it allows associated image chips or quality related features to be sent in an
 * MPEG-2 transport stream to support reduced bandwidth, partial-reference techniques for IQ
 * estimation at the receiver.
