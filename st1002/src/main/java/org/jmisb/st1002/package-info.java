/**
 * ST 1002: Range Motion Imagery.
 *
 * <p>This standard describes Range Motion Imagery, its format and supporting metadata. Range Motion
 * Imagery is a temporal sequence of Range Images. Each Range Image is a collection of Range
 * Measurements from a sensor to target scene. A Range Measurement is the distance (e.g., meters)
 * from an object (or area) in the scene to the sensor. The KLV structures of this Standard are
 * intended to allow for flexibility, efficient packing, and future extensions. Range Motion Imagery
 * can be used standalone or in collaboration with other Motion Imagery. MISB ST 1107 Metric
 * Geopositioning Metadata Set provides the basis for collaborating with other Motion Imagery types.
 *
 * <p>This standard describes the: Perspective Range Motion Imagery and Depth Range Motion Imagery;
 * the collection methods of Range Motion Imagery; the formats used for storing or transmitting
 * Range Motion Imagery; the supporting metadata needed for Range Motion Imagery including,
 * temporal, uncertainty, and compression parameters; and the alignment to Collaborative Imagery.
